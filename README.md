# Instagram/FB Filter
The Lucid World effect is a series of rotating montages that start with the user pressing the record button which activates the rotation of Instagram effects that as a result create an edited video. By pressing one button the user can put together their favorite music and the editing effect, making it both easy and fun to try out the new Instagram Reels feature.

# How I built it
The effect was built using Spark AR, 3D objects, face tracking and segmentation. We also used the picker UI, UI sliders, light staging, 3D object animation, material setting and logics building.

# What I learned 
I learned more of IG features, the capabilities of Reels and discovered a lot of daring trends of filter.
